      <h1>Getting started</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        PSI-Toolkit is a set of linguistic tools for processing texts written in various
        formats and various languages.
        The majority of tools has been designed for Polish, but also available are tools for
        English, French, German and Russian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full range of PSI-Toolkit functions is offered with the command-line version,
        but you can test most of the features via this web-service.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is going on here?
      </p>
      <img class="screen" src="/img/intro-screen-1.png" />
      <p>
        All you need to process your data is to set the command, type the input text and
        run PSI-Toolkit.
      </p>

      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>
        Commands let you specify what you want to do, for instance, to <code>tokenize</code>
        or to <code>lemmatize</code>.
        The full command usually is a sequence of three tasks: read, annotate
        and write because data have to be firstly read, then processed (annotated) and finnaly
        displayed.
      </p>
      <img class="screen" src="/img/intro-screen-2.png" />
      <p>
        Note that, you do not have to specify all tasks in your command.
        PSI-Toolkit tries to guess the best tool to complement your task.
        This is why on the first screenshot, neither a reader nor a writer were specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing: <code>--lang pl</code> is an example of an option that can be
        passed to the given tool. All options are described in
        <a href="/help/documentation.html">documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Input data</h2>

      <p>
        To specify input data you want to process, you may choose between typing your text,
        and selecting a file from your disk.
        In the latter case PSI-Toolkit supports such formats as:
        <code>.txt</code>, <code>.doc</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.html</code>,
        <code>.pdf</code> and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may skip a reader and PSI-Toolkit select the best one for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>
        If you are not familiar with available writers, you may select output format
        from the selection list.
        The results may be displayed in various ways depending on the type of writer
        and options you choose.
        Finally, in most cases it is possible to download results in a file.
