GV writer presents the results in a simple graphical form.
For this purpose, it uses GraphViz library - a library for creating graphs (hence GV acronym).

gv-writer shows the content of the lattice as a directed graph.
The text and various annotations are represented by edges of the graph.
For clarity, symbol edges are not shown by default.
To see all edges, use the `--show-symbol-edges` switch.
The edges of different layer tags are distinguished by different colors.
To see the tags' names, use the `--show-tags` switch.
To disable coloring, use the `--no-color` switch.
The range of displayed edges can be restricted with the `--filter` option, which allows to specify the visible layer tags.
When this option is used, only edges with specified layer tags are shown.

gv-writer tries to align lattice vertices left to right.
This default behavior can be disabled by the `--no-align` switch.

The default output format is SVG, but many other formats are also available.
A different output format can be set by the `--format` option.
The list of available output formats: `canon`, `dot`, `eps`, `fig`, `gd`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `gd2`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `gif`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `gv`, `jpe`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `jpeg`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `jpg`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `pdf`, `plain`, `plain-ext`, `png`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `ps`(`:cairo`,`:ps`), `ps2`, `svg`(`:cairo`,`:svg`), `svgz`, `tk`, `vml`, `vmlz`, `wbmp`(`:cairo`,`:gd`), `xdot`.
Detailed description of output formats can be find on <http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats>

gv-writer can be also used in the tree mode, which can be switched on with the `--tree` option.
Tree mode allows for displaying the dependency tree.
When in the tree mode, lattice edges are displayed as tree nodes, and the dependencies between lattice edges are depicted as arrows.
Alternative dependencies are marked with consecutive numbers.
This mode is particularly useful for displaying parse trees.

If gv-writer is not available, you can obtain the graph representation of the lattice in DOT format using dot-writer.
